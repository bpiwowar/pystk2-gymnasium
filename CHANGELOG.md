# Version 0.4.0

- Multi-agent environment
- Use polar representation instead of coordinates (except for the "full" environment)
- Only two base environments (multi/mono-agent) and wrappers for the rest: this allows races to be organized with different set of wrappers (depending on the agent)
- Added `distance_center_path`
- Allow to change player name and camera mode
- breaking: Agent spec is used for mono-kart environments
